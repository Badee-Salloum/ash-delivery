# PROGRESS

## 2026-07-21 — Day 1 (pre-M0): the money core

**Done**

- Read SRS v1.0 and the kickoff brief in full. No blocking brief-vs-SRS conflict; ~16 binding SRS
  details the brief omits are captured in the plan.
- Stack chosen and approved: TypeScript / Fastify 5 / PostgreSQL 17 / Drizzle / React 19 + a
  separate driver PWA / Vitest + fast-check. Four independent proposals, three judges.
- Seven product decisions confirmed and recorded in `CLAUDE.md` and `ASSUMPTIONS.md`.
- **`packages/domain` is written, pure, and green — 65 tests, 732 ms, no Docker.**
  - `money/minor.ts` — branded `bigint` minor units (1 minor = 1/100 new SYP = 1 old lira)
  - `money/allocate.ts` — the residual 80% block, `yalagoCut`, exhaustive `splitBlock`
  - `br1/equation.ts` — BR1 with `cashDiff` / `walletDiff`, not just the scalar
  - `br1/diagnose.ts` — ranked cause breakdown with distinguishable arithmetic signatures
  - `tier/rules.ts` + `tier/split.ts` — band validation, whole + marginal, day-level true-up
  - `time/civil.ts` — Asia/Damascus business dates, Sunday→Saturday weeks, no `Date`/`Intl`
- `scripts/check-domain-pure.mjs` enforces domain purity — and is **negative-tested**: it genuinely
  fails on an injected violation.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS.md`, `TESTS.md` written and current.

**See it in 2 minutes**

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r test                                  # 65 green
npx vitest run test/br1/canonical.test.ts     # the client's own §2.3 example, verbatim
node scripts/check-domain-pure.mjs
```

The canonical test reproduces the SRS §2.3 table row for row — end cash 160,000, end wallet 70,000,
230,000 == 150,000 + 0.80×100,000, difference zero — then splits it at approval into Yallago 20,000
/ driver 40,000 / company 40,000.

**Next**

1. **Send `docs/client-request-samples.md`** — one real shift's dashboard + wallet screenshots and
   the manager's counted ground truth. Blocking for M2; see Risks.
2. The two remaining Day-1 spikes: photo legibility at ~300 KB, and the three Postgres guards
   (deferred balance trigger, `REVOKE` on the ledger, locked-week rejection).
3. M0 — auth, RBAC-as-data, audit, i18n/RTL shell, CI, staging live.

**Risks**

- 🔴 **BR1 is measured against a number Yallago produces and we do not control.** If their wallet
  figure carries tips, promo credits, cancellation reversals, a pending/settled split, or a
  different rounding direction, every shift is unclosable on day one. Mitigation: get one real
  shift before M2; pilot with `br1_split_gate = advisory`; only then make the gate strict.
- 🟠 **The 19-day contract.** Realistic estimate is 40 days (merged plan) to 56 (independent
  review). Re-cut into Bundle 1a + 1b agreed with the PO — **still needs saying to the client in
  writing, this week.**
- 🟠 **The two screens nobody itemised** — driver order entry (20 rows typed on a cheap Android,
  twice a day, with OCR deferred) and the C-7 approval screen. ~2 days each, now budgeted in M3.
- 🟡 Local Node is 25.8; the project targets Node 24 LTS. `.nvmrc` pins 24 and `engines` warns.
  Harmless for the pure domain, but CI and the Dockerfile must pin 24.
- 🟡 Docker is not on PATH in this shell — needed for the M2 Testcontainers work and the DB spike.
